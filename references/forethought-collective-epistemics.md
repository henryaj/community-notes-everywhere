# Forethought — Design Sketches for Collective Epistemics

**Source:** [forethought.org/research/design-sketches-collective-epistemics](https://www.forethought.org/research/design-sketches-collective-epistemics)

## Summary

Forethought's research explores how to design systems that improve collective understanding of truth. The core idea is that we can build tools enabling communities to collaboratively evaluate claims, provide context, and surface reliable information — even in adversarial or polarized environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Community Notes model:** Twitter/X's Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) demonstrates that crowd-sourced fact-checking can work at scale when the rating system is designed to reward bridging — notes rated helpful by people who typically disagree.
- **Bridging-based ranking:** Instead of simple majority voting, prioritize contributions that earn approval across ideological divides. This resists capture by partisan groups.
- **Contextual annotations:** Rather than binary true/false labels, provide additional context that helps readers evaluate claims themselves.
- **Reputation systems:** Trust scores derived from a user's history of providing helpful context, not just their popularity or follower count.
- **Decoupled from platforms:** The vision extends beyond any single platform — annotations that travel with content across the web.

## Design Principles for This Project

1. **Open annotation layer:** Any webpage can have community notes attached to specific passages.
2. **Reputation seeding:** Bootstrap trust from existing social signals (X account age, followers) then refine based on note quality.
3. **Bridging scores (future):** Move toward scoring that rewards notes appreciated across different user clusters.
4. **Transparency:** Users can see why notes are rated helpful or not.
5. **Human-first:** Start with human-authored notes before considering AI assistance.
